			<h2>About TIPs</h2>

			<p>TIPs was conceived at the University of Victoria by Theodore Grosson and Jaclyn Jensen as a tool to easily compare features of different telescopes and instruments. While there are a wide variety of telescopes to choose from when conducting research, it can be overwhelming for early-career astronomers to navigate the alphabet soup of acronyms and determine which instruments are best suited for their specific observations. The goal of TIPs is to offer a starting point for making these comparisons, offering a unified list of telescope locations, resolutions, bandpasses, typical science use cases, and more. Users can search and filter by these categories to make comparisons as easy as possible.</p>

			<p>TIPs is a community-driven resource which we hope to continue expanding to include profiles of instruments available across the world. While we aim to provide accurate and up-to-date information, TIPs is intended as a guide only and should not replace consultation of official observatory documentation.</p>
